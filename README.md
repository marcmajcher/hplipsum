# HPLipsum
## A _lorem ipsum_ generator based on the works of weird fiction author H.P. Lovecraft.

HPLipsum uses a simple Markov chain derived from a number of H.P. Lovecraft stories to generate new, random Lovecraftian texts with a specified number of paragraphs, and minimum number of words per paragraph. 

The generator draws from the following texts, which are unaltered save the substitution of "fella" for a certain word, and a few formatting adjustments. 

* At the Mountains of Madness
